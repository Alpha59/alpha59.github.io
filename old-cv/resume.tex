\coverletter{Please find enclosed my resume, which outlines my relevant experience for this position, as well as my education. I recently graduated from Drexel University in Philadelphia, with a degree in Computer Engineering. I have gained over six years of experience working with a full stack of web technologies and software development. I have gained a great deal of experience writing technical reports, and documentation. I believe that one of my strengths is the design and implementation of software solutions. I am quick to learn new skills in any position, and enjoy learning new languages, libraries, or frameworks; if you do not see a technology that you work with on my resume, I will be more than willing to learn how to use it.}{My previous experience has been focused on server-side technologies, including HTTP based requests. My focus on Server-side technologies has given me the ability to work with a variety of languages, including C++, php, Python, and Node.js. I have also worked extensively with Amazon Web Services, including installation of languages, Web-servers, and database systems. I have had the pleasure of working with a large number of SQL and NoSQL database in the position that I have held in the past, and look forward to the opportunity to work with more. I believe that any team I am given the opportunity to work with will find that I am a dedicated employee who looks for the best solution to any problem.}
